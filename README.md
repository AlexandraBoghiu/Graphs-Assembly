# Graph-Project

  Project within the Computer System Architecture laboratory, year 1, semester 1. The project was written in Assembly, more precisely MIPS.
  
  Requirements:
   - [x] Given the adjacency matrix, print every network equipment (nodes) that is connected to a malicious switch
   - [x] Starting from the first network equipment, print every host it can communicate with and decide if there is a connection
   - [x] Given two hosts and a message, print the original message sent by the source; if there is a malicious switch that connects the hosts, the message must be decrypted by using Caesar's chiper shifting 10
